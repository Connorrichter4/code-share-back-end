# Code Share

## Description:

Application where users can post and share code snippets. Users can post their own code snippets to save for future use and ease of accessability. Instead of digging through old projects and assignments to find a certain function you wrote, it could be saved on the app for quick reference.

## Models:

User model: email, password, number of posts.
code model: Title, Img, body, description, timestamp, likes, number of saves, language, public, private

## Post MVP

User data would be available globally, you would be able to interact with other users. See their public code, and interact with it via likes, and saves. also add public and private options to the. Make public code searchable and filterable by keyword or language type.
